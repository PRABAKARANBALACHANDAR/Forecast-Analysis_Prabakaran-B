TECHNICAL REPORT: SARIMA FORECASTING MODEL FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT PASSENGER JOURNEYS
================================================================================

1. ALGORITHM SELECTION: SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

   SARIMA was selected for this forecasting task because:
   - Explicitly models seasonality (critical for weekly patterns in transport data)
   - Handles non-stationary time series through differencing
   - Captures both autoregressive and moving average components
   - Provides confidence intervals for uncertainty quantification
   - Well-established statistical foundation with interpretable parameters

2. MODEL SPECIFICATION

   SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s) where:
   - (p, d, q): Non-seasonal ARIMA parameters
     * p: Autoregressive order (lags of the series)
     * d: Differencing order (to achieve stationarity)
     * q: Moving average order (lags of forecast errors)
   
   - (P, D, Q, s): Seasonal parameters
     * P: Seasonal autoregressive order
     * D: Seasonal differencing order
     * Q: Seasonal moving average order
     * s: Seasonal period (7 days for weekly seasonality)

   Model Parameters Used:
   - Seasonal period (s): 7 days (weekly seasonality)
   - Parameter selection: Auto-tuned based on AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
   - Common configurations tested: (1,1,1)(1,1,1,7), (2,1,2)(1,1,1,7), etc.

3. DATA PREPROCESSING

   - Missing Data Handling:
     * Created continuous daily time series (reindexed to full calendar)
     * Time-based interpolation for gaps up to 7 days
     * Forward/backward fill for remaining gaps
     * Total missing days filled: ~246 days per service
   
   - Outlier Treatment:
     * Detected using IQR method (1.5 * IQR threshold)
     * Outliers identified and flagged but preserved in dataset
     * Outlier counts saved to separate CSV files for review
   
   - Data Quality:
     * Negative values removed (invalid for passenger counts)
     * Continuous daily series ensures no gaps for time series modeling

5. MODEL VALIDATION

   Validation Strategy: Temporal split (last 30 days held out for testing)
   
   Performance Metrics:
   - Local Route: Forecast generated successfully
   - Light Rail: Forecast generated successfully
   - Peak Service: Forecast generated successfully
   - Rapid Route: Forecast generated successfully
   - School: Forecast generated successfully

6. FORECASTING APPROACH

   - Separate SARIMA models trained for each service type
   - 7-day forecast horizon starting from last available date
   - Predictions constrained to non-negative values
   - 95% confidence intervals provided for uncertainty quantification
   - Seasonal period of 7 days captures weekly patterns

7. KEY INSIGHTS AND ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

   a) BEST DAYS TO TRAVEL (Least Crowded):
      - Local Route: Travel on Sunday instead of Wednesday for 83.6% fewer passengers
      - Light Rail: Travel on Sunday instead of Wednesday for 58.5% fewer passengers
      - Rapid Route: Travel on Sunday instead of Wednesday for 68.4% fewer passengers

   b) WEEKEND ADVANTAGE:
      - Local Route: Weekends have 78.6% fewer passengers than weekdays
      - Light Rail: Weekends have 48.6% fewer passengers than weekdays
      - Rapid Route: Weekends have 61.8% fewer passengers than weekdays

8. MODEL ASSUMPTIONS

   - Weekly seasonal patterns remain stable
   - No major structural breaks (e.g., service changes, strikes)
   - Historical patterns continue into forecast period
   - Residuals are white noise (no autocorrelation)

9. LIMITATIONS

   - Cannot capture sudden external shocks or events
   - Assumes stationarity after differencing
   - Limited to 7-day horizon for reliability
   - Does not incorporate external factors (weather, holidays, events)
   - May struggle with long-term structural changes

10. RESIDUAL DIAGNOSTICS

    - Ljung-Box test performed on residuals
    - Residuals should be white noise (p > 0.05) for good model fit
    - Residual plots available in diagnostics

11. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES CONSIDERED

    - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing: Good for seasonality but less flexible
    - Prophet: Excellent for holidays but requires more parameters
    - LSTM/Neural Networks: Complex, requires more data
    - Random Forest: Good for non-linear patterns but less interpretable

12. RECOMMENDATIONS

    - Monitor forecast accuracy and retrain models monthly
    - Incorporate holiday calendar and special events
    - Add exogenous variables (weather, strikes, events)
    - Consider hierarchical forecasting for multiple services
    - Implement automated model selection with cross-validation
